									<p>We can manage <em>every detail</em> of your facility that is deemed to be outside the scope of your expertise. Let us be the experts in the support services you need, while <em>you focus on what's most important: <b>production!</b></em> We work with the client to complete a comprehensive and systematic analysis of every possible need that the facility may have. We then prepare a detailed initial scope of work, which will become a living document that AI's employees are constantly reevaluating. This scope of work will grow and develop over time, to assure that services are being rendered efficiently and effectively, even as your production needs and circumstances evolve.</p>

								<h5>Industrial Deep Cleaning</h5>
								<p>Typically, the first part of the process requires a thorough deep cleaning of the facility. This deep cleaning is meant to prepare the facility for the maintenance cleanings that will follow. Utilizing our proprietary cleaning products and processes, we are able to deep clean any facility. We have extensive experience working with customers in the automotive paint industry, and can use that experience, and our expertise, to complete any specialized deep cleaning. After completing the deep cleaning, we will then work with you to ensure that the facility retains the level of cleanliness required to keep your reworks low, and your quality high!</p>
