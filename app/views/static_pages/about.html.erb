		<h4 class="text-center">AutoChem Industrial is founded on three core principles that guide us:</h4>
	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-12">
		<div class="well">
			<dl>
				<dt>Always keep the customer's needs in clear and complete focus.</dt>
				<dd>This means that we must always be reevaluating and seeking to understand those needs, whether we have been working with a customer for 20 days, or 20 years, we must always make sure that everything that we do is done in the way that best addresses our customer's needs right now.</dd>
				<dt>Always value innovation and change over doing things they way they've been done before.</dt>
				<dd>AutoChem Industrial was born out of an insight. The industrial cleaning industry is filled with companies who's profit motive is driven by inefficiency, vague scopes of work, and bloated invoices. We could see better way. We believed in taking a novel approach; one based not on sheer volumes of labor, but on results, innovation, and efficiency. In an industry that is paralyzed by the fear of change, we dare to ask why; and why not?</dd>
				<dt>Compete everyday to be better than we were the day before.</dt>
				<dd>As a small company, disrupting the business model used by much larger companies in our industry, we must constantly strive to be better, everyday. We cannot afford complacency or accepting mediocre results. We have to be there, giving 110% everyday for every customer, or we simply won't survive. </dd>

	<h1>AutoChem Industrial: A History</h1>


	<h3>AutoChem Industrial began as an idea and a dream in 2009.</h3>

	<p>Founded upon innovation and positive disruption by introducing creative ideas and solutions, upon a belief that doing things as they always have been done is often an excuse and not a sound business strategy, and upon a constant drive to always compete with ourselves, to always be better than we were yesterday.</p>
